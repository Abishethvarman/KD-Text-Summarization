The system consists of two proteins: Cas9, which is a nuclease that cuts DNA, and a guide RNA that directs Cas9 to a specific DNA sequence. The guide RNA is complementary to a section of DNA called a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). The PAM is a sequence of three nucleotides that is recognized by Cas9. When the guide RNA and Cas9 bind to the PAM, the Cas9 nuclease cuts the DNA at the PAM. The cut DNA is then repaired by the cell’s DNA repair machinery.
