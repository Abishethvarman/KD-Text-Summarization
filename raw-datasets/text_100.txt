30. Neuroscience is unveiling the mysteries of the brain, leading to innovations like brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which enable direct communication between the brain and external devices. These technologies offer hope for individuals with disabilities and open new frontiers in computing and human augmentation. Ethical, legal, and privacy considerations must evolve alongside the technology to ensure responsible use.

31. We engage in unhealthy behaviors because of our genetics, because of brain neurotransmitters, because of environmental influences such as peers and the media. Each of those pieces of the puzzle are not things that you and I can solve on our own. But there is one piece of this puzzle that may hold the key: Our choices about what we do with our cravings to engage in addictive behaviors like smoking or overeating. There is a new science of self-control that may hold the key to reversing these epidemics. It's called willingness. Willingness means allowing your cravings to come and to go, while not acting on them by smoking or eating unhealthy.

32. We get that same stimulation when we check Facebook. We get this dopamine coursing through our mind. And so we not only crave distraction, but our mind rewards us for seeking out and finding distraction in the first place. So, this is the state of our minds today. We're at this hyperstimulated state where we bounce around between these bunch of different objects of attention that are very, very stimulating for our mind.

33.  your brain actually functions by transferring chemicals signals between brain cells, what we call neurons, and this triggered a series of actions and reactions. So to support learning, your brain can increase the amount or the concentrations of these chemical signaling that's taking place between neurons. Because this change can happen rapidly, this supports short-term memory or the short-term improvement in the performance of a motor skill. The second way that the brain can change to support learning is by altering its structure. So during learning, the brain can change the connections between neurons.

34. the challenge is that we know in schools all around the world, English is not really being taught like it's a tool to play with. It's still being taught like it's an art to master. And students are judged more on correctness than on clarity. Some of you might remember the old comprehension exam in school. Does everybody remember in school when you'd get a question about a text that you read, you'd have to read through some text, right? And then answer a question to show that you understood the text? And this may have happened to you that you showed you understood the text, but you got a big X because you made a little grammar mistake.

35. They're the first inhabitants of this reality that we take for granted. First to discover that there is something other than oneself. A world of many selves. The ability to see is thought to have ushered in Cambrian explosion, a period in which a huge variety of animal species entered fossil records. What began as a passive experience, the simple act of letting light in, soon became far more active. The nervous system began to evolve. Sight turning to insight. Seeing became understanding. Understanding led to actions. And all these gave rise to intelligence. Today, we're no longer satisfied with just nature's gift of visual intelligence. Curiosity urges us to create machines to see just as intelligently as we can, if not better.

36. The last 10 years, diligently, and some may say obsessively, trying to peek beyond the curve. What I think is next is that we need an entirely new kind of computer. One that speaks our language instead of forcing us to speak their language of swipes and clicks. A computer that we can talk to. And not in the way that you speak at Siri with loud, robotic voice commands, but in the way that we talk with each other.So genuine, engaging conversation. So a new kind of natural language computing built on a new kind of compute hardware. So we've been building this new kind of computer in secret for six years now, and today is the first time that we're talking about it publicly. So this is a prototype “audio computer,” as we call them.

37. It was a real revolution at the time. So this was in 2012, 2013 where we coined these terms "deep reinforcement learning." And the key thing about them is that those systems were learning directly from the pixels, the raw pixels on the screen, but they weren't being told anything else. So they were being told, maximize the score, here are the pixels on the screen, 30,000 pixels. The system has to make sense on its own from first principles what’s going on, what it’s controlling, how to get points.

38. That's completely normal because we live in a world where judgment and criticism are constant. Everything we do, every action we take, every risk we face invites countless opinions either good or bad. And in today's social media driving world, those opinions come faster, louder, and in every direction. Sometimes only through one post, a snapshot, or even a story shared by someone else. People then form impression about your life, your success, and then your worth.

39. I become a more well-rounded version of myself that all of yours looking at. And the most important thing is through all that I become a better version and I be able to reach the first milestone of the dream that I had held on to for so long. And on that journey this is what I achieved. This was not all luck. It was an effort. None of this was given me for free. It was hard work. We're not princesses in fairy tales or bystander in our own life story. We don't need magic. What we need is knowledge, action, and courage.

40. This is where we are now, right? We speak not very well to people who simply aren't listening in an environment that's all about noise and bad acoustics. I have talked about that on this stage in different phases. What would the world be like if we were speaking powerfully to people who were listening consciously in environments which were actually fit for purpose? Or to make that a bit larger, what would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously and consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments

41. This is a ubiquitous fear, and one that I believe we can learn to manage. And I use that word manage very carefully because I don't think we ever want to overcome it. Anxiety actually helps us. It gives us energy, helps us focus, tells us what we're doing is important. But we want to learn to manage it. So I'd like to introduce you to a few techniques that can work and all of these techniques are based on academic research.

42. You'll make some mistakes here and there and just take a lot of time and in most cases you lose the motivation to actually do it. Now the best part about manus is that it does all the research on your behalf. So anything from doing market research to understanding if there are any companies that you can reach out to. So it does lead generation for you and it also does some financial research that you want it to do.

43. Many people don't know that Zim actually was instrumental in starting one of the very first shyness institutes in the, the world and especially in the country. And I did some research with him that looked at how your orientation to time influences how you react. And what we learned is if you can bring yourself into the present moment, rather than being worried about the future consequences, you can actually be less nervous.

44. This is some sci-fi stuff that we’re dealing with but whatever happens in court. We as a society and machine learning as an industry, need to establish the legal and ethical groundwork that is going to govern all emerging systems of this sort. If we don’t, if we allow the appropriation of everybody’s creative work for the benefit of technology, that is just going to turn around and compete directly against them in their very markets, we are going to do untold damage to the vigor and energy that people have for their work. People like me, and my students, and my friends and you

45. Saratoga's another example of a beauty cream which you can create ads of instantly using photo image generator. So now we are able to create content, we're able to do marketing, able to do sales, we're able to create websites, we're also able to get market research all with the help of AI tools. Now the last thing that I want to talk about is automating learning because of course you have to know about these things to start using them and Google AI studio makes it really easy for you to turn any software which looks confusing to you.

46. We need to figure out who exactly we think the future is for. I think it's for people, not for machines. So what can we do? Well, first off, we need to acknowledge that we have power. These systems would not exist without our data and our content. And if the people making these things don't want the valuable data that they use to train their products to up and vanish, they're going to have to help keep the markets healthy. So resist. Speak up.

47. Wanting things! You don’t even need to know what you want. We live in a society where companies are happy to tell you what to want. Facebook, Google. YouTube. They're investing billions and developing this ever clearer picture of us through the one way mirror of their services. Every day we tell them more about what we want to see, hear, play, buy, everything.

48. And I would describe that neurologically, but it's a relatively recent concept. There’s not a complete consensus on all the brain regions included in the definition of it. But what we do know is that these are the areas of the brain that are active when your brain is at wakeful rest, like daydreaming. So when you're spacing out in the shower, when you’re sitting in the car on a long, boring drive, when you’re fused to a breast pump, that’s when your default mode engages, When your brain has nothing better to do, you dip into these emotional and memory centers of the brain.

49. Endless distraction available 24-7. But what is that doing to us? The key idea here is finding a way to utilize mindlessness as a way of becoming more mindful. And I don’t want you to be mindless all the time. Nobody wants that. We don’t want to be spacing out all the time. We just want to be able to focus when we want to focus.

50. This transmission is for future generations. As it stands, a small sliver of humanity is currently imposing their visions on the rest of us. They invest in space travel and AI superintelligence and underground bunkers, while casting health care and housing for all as outlandish and unimaginable. These futurists let their own imaginations run wild when it comes to bending material and digital realities, but their visions grow limp when it comes to transforming our social reality so that everyone has the chance to live a good and meaningful life.

51. We partnered with private companies, asking, which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs? And who's going to earn the most money? In all those very different contexts, one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success. And it wasn't social intelligence. It wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't IQ. It was grit. Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. Grit is having stamina.

52. Now, sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun, like when you're having dinner or going to bed or enjoying well-earned leisure time. That's why there's an overlap. Sometimes they agree. But other times, it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant, for the sake of the big picture. And that's when we have a conflict. And for the procrastinator, that conflict tends to end a certain way every time, leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone, an easy and fun place that's entirely out of the Makes Sense circle.

53. Now if the procrastinator's only mechanism of doing these hard things is the Panic Monster, that's a problem, because in all of these non-deadline situations, the Panic Monster doesn't show up. He has nothing to wake up for, so the effects of procrastination, they're not contained; they just extend outward forever

54. Society has taught us that being an introvert is the worst thing you can be and that everyone should want to be extroverted. We're told that being outgoing is good and being shy and quiet is bad. We're told in elementary school we have to raise our hands, participate in class or we lose marks. Every year at parent-teacher interviews, my parents would hear the same thing, "Your daughter is very shy, she needs to learn to speak up more.

55. I can't imagine my life without a book. What I'm comparing is the lost art of reading, writing, communicating and persuading to some of the great societal ills of the text message, the tweet and the snap. While these wonders of modern technology have their place, we, the young generation, have to hold on to reading.

56. Together, they're reminding us that deadly systems may seem durable, but they're not inevitable. And we don’t simply have to click: submit. We can each work to strengthen the social fabric in our own locale and create a shared vision in which no one is left behind. We can follow the example of data justice organizers in Barcelona, forest defenders in Atlanta, imagining and crafting the worlds we cannot live without, just as we dismantle the ones we cannot live within.

57. Introverts are known to be versatile, responsible, work well in small groups and individually. So being an introvert has no effect on how happy or how successful you are going to be as long as you see it in the right lighting. If you see yourself as an introvert and think it's the worst thing in the world, you're never going to be truly happy with yourself and you're going to constantly try to change to conform to society.

58. People who spent time caring for others showed absolutely no stress-related increase in dying. Zero. Caring created resilience. And so we see once again that the harmful effects of stress on your health are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your experience of stress. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful, you create the biology of courage

59. we humans are we don't even think that one significant person can make such a big difference in the world but the be has shown me that such a small thing can make such a drastic change on this planet what was the point of this short talk the point was to open your eyes to the fact that we humans are not so different from every other living creature we are not the amazing breakthrough in life in this universe

60. One of the things that we never discuss or we rarely discuss is the value and importance of human connection. Relationships. James Comer says that no significant learning can occur without a significant relationship. George Washington Carver says all learning is understanding relationships. Everyone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult.

61. See, it's hard to teach kids who stink. And kids can be cruel. And so she kept those things in her desk, and years later, after she retired, I watched some of those same kids come through and say to her, "You know, Ms. Walker, you made a difference in my life. You made it work for me. You made me feel like I was somebody, when I knew, at the bottom, I wasn't.

62. Now, in a typical stress response, your heart rate goes up, and your blood vessels constrict like this. And this is one of the reasons that chronic stress is sometimes associated with cardiovascular disease. It's not really healthy to be in this state all the time. But in the study, when participants viewed their stress response as helpful, their blood vessels stayed relaxed like this.

63.To understand this side of stress, we need to talk about a hormone, oxytocin, and I know oxytocin has already gotten as much hype as a hormone can get. It even has its own cute nickname, the cuddle hormone, because it's released when you hug someone. But this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in. Oxytocin is a neuro-hormone. It fine-tunes your brain's social instincts.

64. So be generous. And go out and give someone a nice full compliment. So, I have this belief about a "compliment immunity meter", and it comes from this experience I had when I met this gorgeous supermodel. And I look at her and I say, "Wow! You are beautiful!" And there is no reaction on her face. And I think to myself, "How?" That's when I realized, she is immune to the word "beautiful.

65. I talk to people that I like. I talk to people that I don’t like. I talk to some people that I disagree with deeply on a personal level. But I still have a great conversation with them. So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes or so teaching you how to talk and how to listen. Many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this, things like look the person in the eye, think of interesting topics to discuss in advance, look, nod and smile to show that you're paying attention, repeat back what you just heard or summarize it.

66. We teach anyway, because that's what we do. Teaching and learning should bring joy. How powerful would our world be if we had kids who were not afraid to take risks, who were not afraid to think, and who had a champion? Every child deserves a champion, an adult who will never give up on them, who understands the power of connection, and insists that they become the best that they can possibly be.

67. When you start at that point and then move outward from there, you will find that all of a sudden the conversation becomes a lot easier. And that's because both of you suddenly are on the same side of something. And that's a really powerful feeling.

68. Conversations can make war and conversations can make peace. And conversations define who we are as a human race. Think about this. Every single person in your life was once a stranger to you. And you knew nothing about them until you had that first conversation. So I'm here today to tell you to talk to strangers, to have a conversation.

69. Doing what I love has not only changed my life, but affected the lives around me, got me through some of my toughest times, and shaped me into the person that I am today. When I was 14, a family friend was diagnosed with terminal cancer. She held on for a while, but eventually couldn't escape the words, "You only have a few days left.

70. Well, change doesn’t come easy. You have to incorporate certain habits in your life that all eventually lead to you becoming the best version of yourself. You also have to eliminate certain habits that are hindering your path. Well, how long will it take you to form a new habit or get rid of an old one? Most people will tell you it takes exactly 21 days for a person to form a habit or get rid of an old one.

71. Stay out of the weeds. Frankly, people don't care about the years, the names, the dates, all those details that you're struggling to come up with in your mind. They don't care. What they care about is you. They care about what you're like, what you have in common. So forget the details. Leave them out

72. Being unique is part of the human experience. So take the jump. Everything in life is a risk, but you only have one life and doing what you love is a risk worth taking. Remember, if you are not doing what you love, you're wasting your time. But when it comes to something you love, you're never out of time to start

73. It's an incredible experience." A couple of months later, he was approached by a journalist from the New York Times, and they had a long phone call. At the end of the call, the journalist threw in a question that seemed like a sort of softball. He said to him, "Your kids must love the iPad." There's an obvious answer to this, but what Jobs said really staggered the journalist.

74. CA: But people -- seen traditionally, it's incredibly expensive to dig, and that would block this idea. EM: Yeah. Well, they're right. To give you an example, the LA subway extension, which is -- I think it's a two-and-a-half mile extension that was just completed for two billion dollars. So it's roughly a billion dollars a mile to do the subway extension in LA. And this is not the highest utility subway in the world. So yeah, it's quite difficult to dig tunnels normally. I think we need to have at least a tenfold improvement in the cost per mile of tunneling

75. what's the take home here? Screens are miraculous; I've already said that, and I feel that it's true. But the way we use them is a lot like driving down a really fast, long road, and you're in a car where the accelerator is mashed to the floor, it's kind of hard to reach the brake pedal. You've got a choice.

76. We've heard interviews often in which a guest is talking for several minutes and then the host comes back in and asks a question which seems like it comes out of nowhere, or it's already been answered. That means the host probably stopped listening two minutes ago because he thought of this really clever question, and he was just bound and determined to say that.


77. Every stranger comes with an opportunity, an opportunity to learn something new, an opportunity to have an experience you've never had or hear a story that you've never heard before. And you've had that moment, right? You're in the room with someone you don't know, and you look across the room, you see a stranger, and you think, "I want to talk to this person.

78. And once you begin, make sure to maintain your new habit, make it a part of your schedule, set reminders create a supportive environment and most importantly you don’t have to be perfect, making a mistake once or twice has no lasting effects on your behavior. Actually, that will give you time not to rush yourself into things, you have to give yourself time and not just rush yourself into becoming a better version.

79. It isn't about what happens to you. It's what you do with it, how you get through it, and why it matters that you do. Back when I was a little 10-year-old child, I took out my colored markers and I made a bucket list of everything I wanted to do in my life as a magician. It had everything from talk to another magician to do a show in Vegas to have my own business cards.

80. That leaves this white space. That's our personal time. That space is incredibly important to us. That's the space where we do things that make us individuals. That's where hobbies happen, where we have close relationships, where we really think about our lives, where we get creative, where we zoom back and try to work out whether our lives have been meaningful.

81. We know the distances, of course to the door, but also to the hidden objects, but we don't know which point corresponds to which distance. By shining one laser, we can record one raw photo, which, if you look on the screen, doesn't really make any sense. But then we will take a lot of such pictures, dozens of such pictures, put them together, and try to analyze the multiple bounces of light, and from that, can we see the hidden object? Can we see it in full 3D? So this is our reconstruction.

82. We can instantly understand an environment, just by being present in it. We've built tools like our Mars Rover to extend our vision and lengthen our reach. But for decades, we've explored from a seat behind screens and keyboards. Now, we're leaping over all of that, over the giant antennas and the relay satellites and the vastness between worlds to take our first steps on this landscape as if we were truly there.

83. They can also autonomously build tensile structures. Skills learned include how to carry loads, how to cope with disturbances, and in general, how to interact with the physical world. Today we want to show you some new projects that we've been working on. Their aim is to push the boundary of what can be achieved with autonomous flight. Now, for a system to function autonomously, it must collectively know the location of its mobile objects in space.

84. By bringing holograms into our world, I'm not just talking about a new device or a better computer. I'm talking about freeing ourselves from the 2D confines of traditional computing. Put it this way: temporally adjusted, we're like cave people in computer terms. We've barely discovered charcoal and started drawing the first stick figures in our cave.Now, this is the perspective I apply to my work every single day. And now for the next few minutes, I invite all of you to apply the same perspective to the journey ahead of us.

85. My other motivation to create this network was worry. I fear that the future of our internet is out of our control. The increasing centralization and the proposed laws are threatening our freedom of speech and, by that, our democracy. So for me, building a decentralized web means creating a safe harbor, a space where the rules are not written by big corporations and political parties, but by the people.

86. Instead, we use sound to listen for features like pitch and tone and rhythm and volume to infer a story behind the sounds. That's Alice talking. That's Bob interrupting. Silly Bob. So, the same is true of gravitational waves. We can't use them to make simple images of things out in the Universe. But by listening to changes in the amplitude and frequency of those waves, we can hear the story that those waves are telling. And at least for LIGO, the frequencies that it can hear are in the audio band.

87. We went to the Internet, the biggest treasure trove of pictures that humans have ever created. We downloaded nearly a billion images and used crowdsourcing technology like the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform to help us to label these images. At its peak, ImageNet was one of the biggest employers of the Amazon Mechanical Turk workers: together, almost 50,000 workers from 167 countries around the world helped us to clean, sort and label nearly a billion candidate images. That was how much effort it took to capture even a fraction of the imagery a child's mind takes in in the early developmental years.

88. Relativity and quantum mechanics tell us that it has two natural settings, a bit like a light switch. It should either be off, so that it has a zero value everywhere in space, or it should be on so it has an absolutely enormous value. In both of these scenarios, atoms could not exist, and therefore all the other interesting stuff that we see around us in the universe would not exist. In reality, the Higgs field is just slightly on, not zero but 10,000 trillion times weaker than its fully on value, a bit like a light switch that's got stuck just before the off position.

89. It's easy to say, between 5 and 6pm, I'm going to not use my phone. The problem is, 5 and 6pm looks different on different days. I think a far better strategy is to say, I do certain things every day, there are certain occasions that happen every day, like eating dinner. Sometimes I'll be alone, sometimes with other people, sometimes in a restaurant, sometimes at home, but the rule that I've adopted is: I will never use my phone at the table.

90. The large number of autonomous, coordinated entities offers a new palette for aesthetic expression. We've taken commercially available micro quadcopters, each weighing less than a slice of bread, by the way, and outfitted them with our localization technology and custom algorithms. Because each unit knows where it is in space and is self-controlled, there is really no limit to their number.

91. Even companies founded by hackers, like Facebook was, still have a complicated relationship when it comes to hackers. And so for more conservative organizations, it is going to take time and adapting in order to embrace hacker culture and the creative chaos that it brings with it. But I think it's worth the effort, because the alternative, to blindly fight all hackers, is to go against the power you cannot control at the cost of stifling innovation and regulating knowledge.

92. Basically, this is a people-powered version of the internet. The security of the network is provided by public-key cryptography. This makes sure that no one can modify the sites but only the real owner. Think of it like instead of getting electricity from big power plants, you put solar panels on top of your house, and if your neighbor down the street needs some extra energy, then they can just download some from your house.So by using the decentralized web, we can help to keep content accessible for other visitors.

93. There are hackers everywhere. They come from all walks of life, ethnicities, ideologies and genders, I might add. They are now shaping the world's stage. Hackers represent an exceptional force for change in the 21st century. This is because access to information is a critical currency of power, one which governments would like to control, a thing they attempt to do by setting up all-you-can-eat surveillance programs, a thing they need hackers for, by the way.

94. Our society is more technologically advanced than ever. We send people to the moon, we make phones that talk to us or customize radio stations that can play only music we like. Yet, our most advanced machines and computers still struggle at this task. So I'm here today to give you a progress report on the latest advances in our research in computer vision, one of the most frontier and potentially revolutionary technologies in computer science. Yes, we have prototyped cars that can drive by themselves, but without smart vision, they cannot really tell the difference between a crumpled paper bag on the road, which can be run over, and a rock that size, which should be avoided. We have made fabulous megapixel cameras, but we have not delivered sight to the blind.

95.  Now, we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road, but in the future, we could create cars that avoid collisions with what's around the bend. Or we can look for survivors in hazardous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows. Or we can build endoscopes that can see deep inside the body around occluders, and also for cardioscopes.

96. I'm a football girl I kind of like the coin toss at the beginning of the game I think it symbolizes is this notion of of two sides to the coin right and not just winners and losers but one team gets the ball at the first part of the game and the other team gets it at the second part to me kids and Technology are like two s two sides of a coin technology in the literal sense it's hard it's hyper objective it's infinite in its applications it can beond unforgiving kids they're soft they're embryonic they're emotional they're loving they're stubborn they're brilliant kids are as human as human can get see I don't think technology is making us less human I think it's making us more human

97. Our research field is called computer vision and machine learning. It's part of the general field of artificial intelligence. So ultimately, we want to teach the machines to see just like we do: naming objects, identifying people, inferring 3D geometry of things, understanding relations, emotions, actions and intentions. You and I weave together entire stories of people, places and things the moment we lay our gaze on them.

98. In most of the multiverse, dark energy is so strong that the universe gets torn apart, or the Higgs field is so weak that no atoms can form. We live in one of the places in the multiverse where the two numbers are just right. We live in a Goldilocks universe. Now, this idea is extremely controversial, and it's easy to see why. If we follow this line of thinking, then we will never be able to answer the question, "Why is there something rather than nothing?" In most of the multiverse, there is nothing, and we live in one of the few places where the laws of physics allow there to be something.

99. I believe that we are suffering from a first world problem called food paranoia and we need to think carefully about this I don't know how many of you have actually tried to grow a thousand acres of canola but it's hard work if you punch in GMO images in Google this is what you see now I don't know what's wrong with these fruits and vegetables for one thing almost none of these are GMO crops but maybe they're diabetic maybe they're diabetic because if you are diabetic today or you know any relatives or friends who are diabetic they are being kept alive with a GMO technology GMO insulin Humalog novel in our humo technologies injected into their bodies every day

100. The security of the network is provided by public-key cryptography. This makes sure that no one can modify the sites but only the real owner.
